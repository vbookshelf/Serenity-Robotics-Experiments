## Serenity - Robotics Experiments
This repo contains my experiments with Serenity-1, a simple robot I built to experiment with robotics code and robotics hardware. I also plan to experiment with combining Ai and robotics.

Each experiment is stored in a separate folder. In the experiment folder you will find the Arduino and/or Python code, a wiring diagram and other relevant files. Each folder also has a readme with a short writeup.

### Key Features of Serenity-1

I tried different designs. It was frustrating when connection points were hard to access or hard to see. I also didn't want to spend too much mental energy trying to carefully arrange components on the base to get everything to fit. Also, hiding the wires looked neater but it made swapping out components harder. I wanted the robot to be quick and easy to experiment with. This is the current setup:

1- Large base area (297mm x 210mm x 3mm thick MDF) to allow enough space for sensors, a micro-controller, a single-board computer, a camera and other parts to be easily installed and moved around.<br>
2- Hardware is not screwed down to allow for easy removal or re-positioning. The motors and castor wheel are attached with double sided tape. The electronics are attached to the base with Prestick.<br>
3- Jumper wires are used and a breadboard is attached to allow for easy connections.<br>
4- The robot has two motors instead of four so the batteries last longer.<br>
5- The batteries are placed directly above the wheels. The weight improves traction making it easier for the robot to move.

This was a previous design:

### Robotics Resources

Robotics and electronics may sound complicated but, believe me, it isn't hard to learn - if you have passionate teachers with a gift for making things easy to understand. This is a list of resources to help you. I highly recommend the Udemy Robotics course by Ian Juby. It's what helped me get started.<br>
